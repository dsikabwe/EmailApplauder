# EmailApplauder
A Chrome extension that applauds you when you send an email.

Sending emails is hard sometimes. I get it. With this Chrome extension, you can get an encouraging round of applause whenever you manage to stave off the dread long enough to send one.

## Notes
- This only works in Gmail.
- This code is very ghetto. A makeshift, jury-rigged kludge. This code will break if a single developer at Google so much as sneezes.
- This Chrome extension was based on [this tweet](https://twitter.com/ryan_ken_acts/status/1442519773422575620?s=21).
